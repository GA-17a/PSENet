# Shape Robust Text Detection with Progressive Scale Expansion Network --- Used on Camera-captured Invoice Image

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* PyTorch v0.4.1+
* OpenCV 3.4 (for c++ version pse)
* opencv-python 4.1.0.25

## Introduction
Progressive Scale Expansion Network (PSENet) is a text detector which is able to well detect the arbitrary-shape text in natural scene.
We apply it to camera-captured invoice image here.
